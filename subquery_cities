Here is a SQL query that names the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries by customer count:

SELECT C.city, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
WHERE C.country_id IN
(SELECT C.country_id
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10)
GROUP BY C.city_id
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
