Here is a SQL query of the top 10 movies by revenue:

SELECT D.title, D.rating, SUM(A.amount)
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
GROUP BY title, rating
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount)
LIMIT 10
